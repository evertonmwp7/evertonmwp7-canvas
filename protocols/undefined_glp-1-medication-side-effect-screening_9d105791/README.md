# Summary of Protocol for Systematic Screening of Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to systematically screen for side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists, ensuring early detection and management of adverse effects to improve patient safety and treatment outcomes.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population of patients currently on GLP-1 medications, such as liraglutide and semaglutide. It then narrows down to a subset of patients who have been on these medications for at least four weeks and have not undergone side effect screening in the past three months. Exclusion criteria are outlined to ensure the focus remains on appropriate candidates for screening. The protocol recommends a comprehensive review of medical history, a standardized questionnaire, and necessary laboratory tests to identify potential side effects. Successful screening involves documenting side effects, educating patients, and establishing follow-up plans.

### Important Information:

1. **Initial Population:**
   - Includes all patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists like liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and albiglutide.

2. **Subset for Screening:**
   - Patients on GLP-1 medications for at least four weeks.
   - Patients without a side effect screening in the last three months.

3. **Exclusion Criteria:**
   - Patients with allergies or contraindications to GLP-1 medications.
   - Hospitalized patients or those in acute care settings.
   - Patients who stopped GLP-1 medications over four weeks before the screening.

4. **Diagnostic Interventions:**
   - Comprehensive review of medical history and symptoms.
   - Standardized questionnaire for common side effects like gastrointestinal issues, injection site reactions, pancreatitis, or thyroid tumors.
   - Laboratory tests, such as serum amylase and lipase, if indicated.

5. **Conditions for Successful Screens:**
   - Documenting any side effects experienced by the patient.
   - Communicating findings and educating patients on side effects and management.
   - Recommending healthcare provider consultation for significant side effects or patient concerns.
   - Establishing follow-up plans, including medication adjustments or discontinuation if necessary.
